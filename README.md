### Getir task
I'm using atomic design methodology in this task, 
You can see components at the atoms, molecules, organisms folders.
I'm testing our components with react-test-renderer for their snapshots.
Also project has got a storybook package, all you need to do is npm run storybook || yarn storybook then you can see all of our ui kit.
